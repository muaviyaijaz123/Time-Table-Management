# Timetable Management System: Data Structure Project

## Description
This project is a data structure-based application developed in C++ with the primary goal of implementing a timetable management system for students using efficient data structures. The application handles various functionalities related to student timetables, course schedules, and room allocations.

## Features
- **Efficient Data Storage**: Utilize efficient data structures to store and manage timetable information.
- **Pointer Usage**: Implement pointers for dynamic memory management.
- **Memory Leak Handling**: Ensure proper memory allocation and deallocation to prevent memory leaks.
- **File Handling**: Read data from text files to build the timetable system.

## Files
- `students.txt`: Contains information about students.
- `timetable.txt`: Contains the schedule for all classes.

## Functionalities
- **Save Data**: Efficiently save all timetable and student data using appropriate data structures.
- **Show Student Timetable**: Display the timetable for a specific student.
- **Show Rooms for Courses**: Display the rooms allocated for various courses.
- **Show Sections for Each Course**: Display the sections available for each course.
- **Show Clashes**: Identify and display timetable clashes for students.

## Object-Oriented Techniques Used
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulate data within classes to provide controlled access through public methods.
- **Inheritance**: Use inheritance to model entities and their relationships.
- **Polymorphism**: Override methods to provide specific behavior for different class types.
- **Abstraction**: Hide complex implementation details behind simple interfaces.

## Project Structure
The application uses two major text files to store and manage data:
- `students.txt`: Contains information about students.
- `timetable.txt`: Contains the schedule for all classes.

## File Handling Techniques
The application reads data from these files to build and simulate a timetable management system. Techniques used include:
- **Reading Data**: Reading student and timetable data from text files.
- **Writing Data**: Writing updates back to the text files as the application runs.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the application.
